<h2>Headings Are Great Fun</h2>
<p>This is my first <strong>paragraph</strong> in my new <em>webpage</em>. This is going to be great. I am so excited I can hardly contain <b>myself</b>. Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very useful. </p>
<h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>
<p>Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create web pages is easy and <b>entertaining</b>. This is my second <em>paragraph</em>. I hope you like it.</p>
